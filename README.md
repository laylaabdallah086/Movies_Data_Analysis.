Here’s what I did in the project:

Cleaned the data and converted date columns to proper datetime.

Checked for negative values in budget and box office columns.

Calculated Profit and ROI for each movie.

Analyzed the top movie genres by global box office.

Explored trends, ratings, and more insights from the dataset.

This project helped me strengthen my data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization skills.
I’m looking forward to more projects in data analysis and learning more advanced techniques!
